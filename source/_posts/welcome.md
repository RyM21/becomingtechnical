Welcome to [Becoming Technical](http://becomingtechnical.com/)! I am [Ryan McCarl](http://ryanmccarl.com), a writer, lawyer, teacher, [self-educator](http://wideawakeminds.com), and amateur coder who founded the language-learning website [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com). I love to [teach and learn](http:wideawakeminds.com), but have many interests; as a result, I am always interested in finding the fastest and most efficient path to proficiency in areas that interest me.

## My background with computers and coding


Eventually I somehow stumbled upon [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), the operating system that accompanied Windows. I learned many of the commands and discovered the raw power of the command line. From there I discovered [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic), the elementary programming language built in to MS-DOS. I made many simple programs ranging from file management utilities to role-playing games. I then purchased a book and CD set to teach myself C++, but found that this was too difficult. So I stopped coding and moved on to other interests.

Almost twenty years later, I started coding again after discovering Al Sweigart's *[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://amzn.to/2iURNi5)*. I loved the idea of automation, scripting, and using code to reduce the drudgery of daily errands. I worked through much of that book as well as Charles Severance's *[Python for Informatics](http://amzn.to/2iV47if)* and its accompanying Coursera course, hired a computer science and Python tutor, and began learning other technologies and languages including [Linux command-line tools](http://amzn.to/2iOPlt0), [SQL/SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Angular 2](https://angular.io/), and others. I also started [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com) and began to learn about [Agile project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management), [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)),[ natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [user-experience (UX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) design and testing, and many other topics.

## What to expect

The purpose of this blog is to share what I am learning as I am learning it. The best way to learn a subject is to teach it or write about it, so I hope the posts will both reinforce what I am learning and help others interested in exploring the technologies I am studying.
